# Java Competitive Programming Templates

This repository contains three levels of Java templates designed specifically for Competitive Programming platforms like:

- Codeforces  
- AtCoder  
- CSES  
- LeetCode  
- GeeksForGeeks  

The goal of these templates is to provide **fast I/O**, **clean structure**, and **ready-to-use utilities** so that you can code faster during contests.

## 1. Super Short Java EXPERT CP Template

A minimal, extremely fast, and beginner-friendly Java template.

### **Best For:**
- Div 2 A, B, C problems  
- Beginners  
- Short contests  
- Fast implementation

### **Includes:**
- Fast I/O  
- Ruffle sort (anti-hack shuffle + sort)  
- gcd(), power() helpers  
- Clean main–solve structure  

### **Use Case:**
When you want very short, fast code and only need simple tools.

## 2. MASTER + Powerful Template

A compact but highly functional CP template.  
Balanced for speed and flexibility.

### **Best For:**
- Div 2 B, C, D  
- Medium difficulty problems  
- Graph problems  
- DSU, BFS/DFS usage  
- Dijkstra (shortest path)

### **Includes:**
- Fast I/O  
- DSU (Union-Find)  
- BFS & DFS  
- Dijkstra  
- Fenwick Tree (BIT)  
- gcd, power, ruffle sort  
- Clean and modular structure  

### **Use Case:**
When problem difficulty increases and basic template is not enough.

## 3. Ultimate LGM Java CP Template

A complete competitive programming template.  
Used by high-rated coders (Expert → Master level).

### **Best For:**
- Hard Div 2 & Div 1 problems  
- Graph-heavy problems  
- DP + Range Queries  
- Segment trees  
- Lazy propagation  
- Modular arithmetic  
- Large constraints optimization  

### **Includes:**
- Fast I/O  
- gcd, lcm, power  
- DSU / Union-Find  
- BFS, DFS  
- Dijkstra  
- Fenwick Tree (BIT)  
- Segment Tree  
- Lazy Segment Tree  
- nCr, modular inverse, factorial precomputation  
- Pair class  
- Ruffle sort  
- Reverse array utilities  
- Clean structure with utilities  

### **Use Case:**
When you want EVERYTHING ready before a contest starts.
